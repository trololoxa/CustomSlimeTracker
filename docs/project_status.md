# Project status

This document replaces the completed code-quality roadmap notes. It records the current structural state of the firmware after the architecture cleanup patches.

## Current structural baseline

- `main.cpp` is an Arduino entrypoint only.
- `app/` owns setup/loop orchestration and app-level singleton wiring.
- `app/hooks/` contains include-only glue sections; hooks must stay wiring-only.
- `runtime/` owns FIFO processing, sample pipeline, static tests, machine logs, output snapshots, runtime bias, mag runtime, and tracking state.
- `sensor/` owns math/model code for AHRS, calibration, quality, magnetometer heading, and yaw correction.
- `serial/` command domains are split into `.hpp/.cpp` pairs; parser glue remains fixed-buffer/no-heap.
- `config/` owns persisted schema, runtime apply/capture/sanitize, NVS store, and printing.
- `connection/` owns low-level hardware/protocol drivers.
- `src/network/` owns real Wi-Fi station management and UDP transport; SlimeVR packet formatting/output runtime lives outside low-level network primitives.

## Deliberate developer conveniences

- Boot-time `sleep(2)` remains intentionally. It gives time to open Serial Monitor during development and can be removed in final production cleanup.
- `defines.h` is the canonical compile-time defaults header. No `defines.hpp` shim is used.
- `BOARD_LOLIN_C3_MINI_DIAG` is the normal local build/upload environment while warnings are being kept clean.

## Current quality gate

Run host tests and PlatformIO builds:

```bash
python tools/check_all.py --clean --require-pio
```

If PlatformIO is not on `PATH`, pass `--pio-bin` or set `PIO`.

Host-only check:

```bash
python tools/check_all.py --clean --skip-pio
```

## Remaining structural work

1. Keep `serial/tracker_serial_context.hpp` lightweight by moving reusable parse/print helpers to focused headers.
2. Maintain `docs/cli_reference.md` when commands or side effects change.
3. Maintain `docs/config_schema.md` when persisted schema changes.
4. Build replay/log tooling before major tracking-filter changes.
5. Keep SlimeVR UDP output decoupled from AHRS/FIFO: it must consume prepared output snapshots only, never low-level sensor state directly.

## Current SlimeVR network baseline

The tracker now has a working SlimeVR UDP MVP:

- non-blocking Wi-Fi station manager;
- ESP32-C3 TX power workaround through `TRACKER_WIFI_TX_POWER`;
- UDP discovery and server reconnect;
- SlimeVR protocol v19 metadata;
- `SensorInfo`, `RotationData`, heartbeat, ping/pong, RSSI and temperature telemetry;
- incoming `SetConfigFlag` handling for runtime mag/yaw toggle;
- local serial output decoupled from SlimeVR UDP;
- `slime status` compact view and `slime debug` full counter dump;
- `test runtime <seconds>` for full Wi-Fi/server/FIFO loop-load measurement.

Next optimization work should start from a `test runtime 600` baseline rather than from `test static` alone.
